# Startup Idea Bank

## 1. Secure Access to LLM Platform ("Secure ChatGPT") (Original Idea)

- A platform where companies can deploy and use open-source LLM as easily as possible.

> How does it work?

- The user can either (1) deploy their own instance of the open-source LLM on their AWS account, or (2) use an Azure GPT-4 API with a data security contract.
- The user can then use the LLM on a Slack plugin or a chatbot interface.
- The platform also comes with various integrations and features, such as (1) internal knowledge base integrations (ex: Notion, Zira, Google Drive), (2) multi-modal input (ex: images, PowerPoint), and (3) automatically generate prompt templates for specific industries and use cases.

> Competitors:

- Dashworks: Provides easy knowledge search for companies, has security measures for data security (https://www.dashworks.ai/)
- Cohere: Provides text search and generation with their own LLM model, allows hosting on a private cloud or secure cloud partners (AWS, Oracle, Google) for data security (https://cohere.com/)
- Shakudo: Provides secure cloud hosting for LLM with plugins to 170+ different APIs for enterprise users to set up data pipelines (https://www.shakudo.io/blog/how-to-easily-and-securely-integrate-llms-in-your-enterprise-data-initiatives-with-shakudo-2023)
- ThoughtSpot: Provides AI-generated answers, search suggestions, and data modeling using secure Azure GPT-4 API (https://www.thoughtspot.com/blog/secure-data-processing-with-llm)

> Differentiating Points

- Provides automatic prompt template generation that optimizes the LLM's answer to specific industries and use cases.

## 2. LLM-Driven Research and Decision-Making Assistant ("Research and Decision-Making Assistant")

- A LLM-driven assistant that helps company employees find relevant information to a problem and helps with decision-making progress.

> How does it work?

- Instead of just relying on training data from the internet until 2021 like ChatGPT, this platform web-searches for relevant information up to date, as well as connects to the company's internal knowledge bases and finds relevant information.
- After gathering relevant information and summarizing them for the user, it can also help the user make critical decisions.
- Lately, the LLM will be provided in a secure manner that prevents any data leakage.

> Competitors

- CausaLens: Optimizes company sales, marketing, and operation by analyzing company data using Casual AI (based on the provided data, it tries to identify the cause of the results) (https://www.causalens.com/)
- Palantir: Provides platforms for integrating, visualizing, and analyzing information to enable effective decision-making across a variety of sectors (https://www.palantir.com/)

> Differentiating Points

- The platform can aggregate large amounts of information both from the web and internal knowledge base and summarize in an easy-to-understand manner for non-technical people.
- Based on the found data, the LLM can provide a step-by-step analysis of the data and make a definitive decision.
- Additionally, it can account for various opinions from the user when making decisions.
